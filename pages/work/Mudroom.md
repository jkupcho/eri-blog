A new or expanded mud room can take a cluttered messy entry, and convert it into a clean organized place for your family to transfer from outdoors to in.  

A mud room can be fitted with Custom lockers for coats and boots. 
Depending on the size, a mud room can often double as a laundry room.

No matter your families needs, Enhanced Interiors Remodeling will work for you.
